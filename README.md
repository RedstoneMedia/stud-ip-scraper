![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/stud_ip_scraper)

A blazingly fast 🚀 library for interacting with Stud.IP written in Rust 🦀. \
This allows for interacting with Stud.IP, an online education platform 📚.

*Mainly leverages web scraping techniques to query the data.*

## Features
This crate mainly focuses on logging into a Stud.IP instance using an **Identity Provider** and management of courses.

Here are some key 🔑 things that can be achieved with this crate 📦:
- Querying the user's courses 🔎📚
- Extendable management of course modules 💹🛠
- Querying files and folders of a course 🔎📁
- Downloading files 📥💨
- Querying the members of a course (students, lecturers, tutors) 🔎👨‍🏫
- Querying the groups of a course 🔎👥
- Joining and leaving course groups 🚪

## Usage
To use this crate, you will need to create an instance of the `StudIp` struct.
You can do this with the `login` method:
```rust
use stud_ip::StudIp;

let stud_ip = StudIp::login<MyIdP>("credentials.txt", "studip.example.com").unwrap();
```

*NOTE:* If you want to use the `login` method, you will need to implement the `IdentityProvider` trait for your specific institution first.
If you have a working Identity Provider for your institution, feel free to make a pull request, and I'll add it to the crate.
